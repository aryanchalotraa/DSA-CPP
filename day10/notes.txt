Polish Notation:
  This type of notation was introducted by polish mathematician Likasiewicz.
   -polish noation in data structure tells us about diffrent ways to write an arithmetic expression.


   -An arihmetic expression contain 2 thisngs:
    1. operator:
      Operator is a symbol that represent a specific operation to be performed.
        eg: +,-,*,/,^,%.

    2. oprand:
    operand is a value or a variable on which an opration is perfromed by an oprand
       eg: 0 to 9, a to z , A to Z.

  - there are mainly three type of polish notation.
   1. Infix notaion:
      This polish notation in data structure states that the operator is written in between the operands.
      eg():
      (a+b)* c(a+b)*c
      a+b -c +d 
      (a*b)+(c/d)(a*b)


   2. Prefix notation:
      this notation in data structure states that the operator should be present as a prefix or before  the operands.
       eg: 
            + a b 
            + - a b c + - a b c 
            * a b *  a b 

   3. Postfix Notation:
      this notation in data structure states that the operator should be present as a after the operands.
       - psotfix notaion is a computer understandable format.
      eg :
       a b-
       ab / cd /
       12 5 +3/12 5 +3 /
       8 2 3 * + 8 2 3* +
