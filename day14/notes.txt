Searching:
  search element one by one.
  They are mainly two type:
    1.Linear Search:
      Search element one by one :
      complexity : o(n).
    Alogorithm:
        1. start from the first element.
        2. compare each element with the target.
        3. If a match is found , return the index.
        4. If end is reached without a match , return -1(not found).7 
    2.Binary Search:
    Divide and conure on sorted array.
    Steps:
      compare middle --> move left  or right
    complexity : o(logn).
     - Array must be sorted.
    Sorting :
    Arrranging array elements in increasing or decreasing order is called sorting.

    1.Selection sort :
    Algo:
    1.start drom the first element.
    2 Find the smallest element in the unsorted part of the array.
    3 . swap it with the first element of the unsorted part.
    4. move the boundary of the sorted part by one.
    5. repeat until the entire array is sorted.

    - Complexity:
      best case, avg ,worst oN^2

      2.Bubble sort:
       1 . start from the first element.
       2 compare each pair of adjacent element.
       3 if the left eleement is greater,swap them
       4 repeat the precoess for all element
       5 after each pass the largest element bubble to end 
       6 continue for n-1 passes or until no swap are neended.
       time complexity : best case o(n^2),worst and avg case :0(n^2)
