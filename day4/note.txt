why  are we here?
why do we need skill.
  in-order to join corporate.
  
learn java script : versatile /slow 
java / :   more versatile syatem programming .it is may or may not be oops
python. : programer friendly.very slow/poor at mobile app/ bad at server/ bad with error 
cpp :similar to java .
c#:c sharp

   dsa:
   primitive and non primitive storage type
   function




//sytem information
//memory management information
//Built-in information
//imporant declarration dec[n]


#include<iostream>
//symbolic Constant Dec[n] define the symbol which can use for computation . that symbol can 
//Pre-Processor declarration system and memoery info
//function  Prototype Dec[n] need to declare the before the main and can define after the main


//namespace dec[n]: 
main dec[n]{
  printf("hello",);
  std::cout<<"hello, bolo"; 
  return 0;
}


//primitive and non primitive storage 
how data type and structure are diffrenet


DataType :
C++ two type:
primitive and non primitive

primitive:
          two type:
          1) numeric :
            two type:
            exact--sometime bool(c++) and approx
            int-- sometime bool(c++)    |   approx is of two type:single : float single precision format
                                              double:double double precision format

 
          2)non numeric :  char, wide char 
          3) void

non primitive :drived and user drived 
      drived    : array,function ,pointer,cPP:refrences(C++),


      ->user drived type diff ,union ,structure,class ,enum

//cluster :hashmap

copy construcutre: deep copy and shallow copy
