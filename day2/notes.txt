variable same as container to store any datatype
pointer speacial type of variable which is use to store address of another variable

refrence[&]:
 it return the address of given variable

de-refrence[*]:
it return value at given address

types of pointer :null pointer:
    pointer initialize with nullptr is called Null pointer
     -it is good practice to intilaze pointer with Null to avoid wild pointer.

     void pointer : pointer define using void keyword is called void pointer
     sytax:
     void *ptr_name =NULL;

     it is also called generic pointer


     dangling pointer:
     pointer which indicate memory which is dealloated.


     constant variable:
     constent variable is define using const keywoed
      -we can not override the value of cinstant variable 
      sytax : const int num =20;
              int *ptr =&num


      constant pointer :
      constant pointer is same as constant variable:
      sytax :cost data_type * ptr_name =& variable_name;


pointer to pointer :
it also know as double pointer ,  use to store address of any pointer:
sytax:data_type ** pointer_name = & another_pointer_name;


pointer to function:
  pointer which indicate address of function
