queue: queue is a linear daat structure that stores the data in first in first out  order.

eg:
  printing pages in printer.
  downloading files in some application.


  -opeartaion implemented on the queue:
  1 enqueue(); adding an element to the end of the queue.
  2. dequeue(); : removing an element from the front of the queue.
  3.front();retrieving the element at the front of the queue without removing it.
  4. rear();Retrieving the element at the rear of the queue without removing it.
  5. empty(): return true if queue is empty, otherwise it return false.
-queue is define inside<queue> header file.
-there are mainly four types of queue:
1. simple queue(Linear Queue):

2.circular queue:
  the last poistion is connected back to the first to make a circle.
    - Its prevent wastage of space in a linear queue.
3. Priority queue:
    Elements are based on priority ,  not just an order.
     -Heigher pripority elements are dequeued before lower ones.   
4. Double ended queue(Dequeue):
    Insert and deletion can happen at both end(front and rear).
  -(i) :input restricted queue: Insertion at only one end.
  -(ii).putput restricted queue: deletion from only one end.
Asymptotic Notation:
  The complexity of an algorythm quantifies the amount of time taken by a program to run as a function of length of the input.
   o(n):best case
   o(n/2):avg case
