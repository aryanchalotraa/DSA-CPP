  -stack has one end only.
  -it contain only one pointer to the topmost element of the satck.
  
  example : recursion 
            Do and unDO  mechanism

   Stack function:
            1. push(): use to store the element in stack
            2. pop(): use to remove element from the top of the stack.
            3. top(): return the element at the top of the stack without removing it.
            4.empty():  return true if stac is empty otherwise false.
            5.size(): return number of element in stack.
